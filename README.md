## Task - Products Management

### Key points
- In this task we will work feature wise. That means we pick one object like user, product, etc at a time. We work through it's feature. The steps would be:
  1) We create it's model.
  2) We build it's APIs.
- This project is divided into features namely User, Product. You need to work on a single feature at a time. Once that is completed as per above mentioned steps. You will be instructed to move to next Feature.
- In this project we are changing how we send token with a request. Instead of using a custom header key like x-api-key, you need to use Authorization header and send the JWT token as Bearer token.
